subheadline: The Power of Online Meetings
title:  "RCCPII Collaborates Internationally to Create Awareness of Online Meetings"
teaser: "Throughout the time that RCCPII ran, we realised that a very large percentage of
researchers, students, and support staff at South African Universities, is not using online meeting platforms 
regularly. We want to change that and help our colleagues grow the capacity to meet with anyone, from anywhere to 
learn, collaborate, teach and more."

In April RCCPII will collaborate with Banele Mashinini from TENET, Dimple Sokartara from [GÉANT](https://www.geant.org/) and
Hastings Ndebvu from [UbuntuNet Alliance](https://ubuntunet.net/) to create awareness around the benefits of online meetings
for researchers and students in Africa.

As part of the RCCPII capacity development initiative, several online activities were run. This included 
[eConversations](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/econversations/general/), 
[online mentoring opportunities](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/mentorship/), and 
[online training](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/carpentries/online-mentorship/). 

Online meetings, presentations, and training is supposedly a cheaper way to get access to information. There are discussions
about the challenges of this form of meetup in many other fora - including challenges around internet connectivity, 
technology (i.e. laptops/devices age, setup, etc) and more. But in despite the challenges, there are many African-based colleagues 
who have benefited tremendously from joining or initiating online meetings.

We want to hear from you if you have benefited from joining or hosting online meetings to facilitate collaboration, teaching, or
learning!

For more information, please see our letter below. You can submit a short video clip or some text describing your experience
through our [_online form_](https://forms.gle/wEX28THsWy6mBSw7A) or by [_emailing us_](mailto:videoconferencing-academia).

We look forward to seeing your contributions and bringing this amazingly empowering technology to more people.
