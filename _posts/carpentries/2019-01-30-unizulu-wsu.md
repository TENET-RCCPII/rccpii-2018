The first month of the new year saw another two universities in South Africa joining the list of institutions offering carpentries workshops to develop digital and computing literacy amongst their staff and postgraduate students. Both workshops were arranged by staff from UNIZULU and WSU who had participated in [CarpentryConnect-JHB](http://carpentryconnectza.org/) in 2018 and wanted to bring carpentries skills training to their institutions.

From 15th to 17th January 2019, staff members and students from the Faculty of Arts participated in a Data Carpentry workshop with focus on Social Sciences and learned how to better organise and clean their data and how to do basic analysis and reports in python with jupyter notebooks. Carpentries instructors joined from Wits University in Joburg, SANBI in Cape Town and from Durban.

From 30th January to 1st February 2019, RCCPII supported a Data Carpentry workshop teaching data organisation, cleaning and data analysis with the R software at Walter Sisulu University. The workshop took place in the new Collaborative Library in East London, a space for study, research, and learning with emphasis on utilising electronic and online resources. The workshop was well attended by staff from the different campuses of WSU. Instructors and helpers joined from UFH, UKZN, NWU (Mafikeng and Potchefstroom), UNIVEN and Durban.
