From 18 - 20 March UKZN and RCCPII will be hosting the last Carpentries instructor training event for this round of the RCCPII funding.

Since January 2018, RCCPII introduced more than 500 staff and students affiliated with tertiary education institutions in South Africa to [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) concepts and resources. The Carpentries teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers and other university staff worldwide.

All materials published by the Carpentries are made available under open licenses and re-use and contextualisation is strongly encouraged.

The [instructor training programme](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) introduces participants to concepts around educational psychology and pedagogy as well as practical tips for hosting, organising, and teaching a successful workshop. South Africa currently boasts 34 qualified instructors which is the highest number of qualified instructors in any developing country. Instructors and trainees have an opportunity to become part of a global community of practice around data analysis and computing. Mentorship and professional development opportunities are also available through the Carpentries.

The workshop in March is specifically aiming to build capacity in the Eastern part of South Africa and will be open for participants from universities in KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape.

More information and the application form link is available on [the course website](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2019-03-18-UKZN-ttt/). Please add as much information to the application form to help us
understand why you would be a good candidate for the training.

**The workshop is funded by the DHET through RCCP II and by UKZN through the University Capacity Development Program at UKZN and the Big Data & Informatics research flagship.**
