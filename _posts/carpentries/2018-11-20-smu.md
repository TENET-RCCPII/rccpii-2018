Staff members from the SMU Libraries and Department of ICT recently participated in [CarpentryConnect-JHB](http://carpentryconnectza.org/) where they were
introduced to the Carpentries' resources, community, philosophy, and workshops. The team immediately saw the relevance for colleagues
back at SMU and started arranging their first Carpentries workshop.

Some photos are available on the [SMU website](http://www.smu.ac.za/smu-holds-data-carpentry-workshop/).

The workshop was well attended by staff and students from all over campus. Instructors and helpers joined from the North-West
University's Mafikeng campus.
