Building a community of practice takes time, money, and great people. The UNIVENDA Carpentries team has been building up momentum
since 2016 and have been heavily involved in the African Carpentries initiative over the past few years.

New instructors were trained in October 2017 and again in September 2018, also through workshops facilitated through RCCPII. In
November 2018 the new instructors had an opportunity to teach and help alongside more experienced instructors from SAEON and
the NHLS.
