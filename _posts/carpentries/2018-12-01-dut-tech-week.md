The Carpentries community on the East Coast of South Africa has recently seen considerable growth due to various RCCPII
capacity development activities, collaborations with staff and students at DUT and UKZN, and volunteer activities from
UKZN's post-doctoral research fellow, Katrin Tirok.

In December, DUT's IT department in collaboration with DUT Library, KZN eskills CoLab and NEMISA, will be hosting a tech week
for staff and students. The workshops will include a [Software Carpentry workshop](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2018-12-04-DUT-SWC)
aimed at staff and students working in and
studying computational sciences. A [Data Carpentry workshop](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2018-12-04-DUT-DC/)
will be run simultaneously for staff and students working in
data-intensive areas.

More information about the DUT Tech Week can be found on [their website](https://www.dut.ac.za/dut-to-host-tech-week/).

At the same time UKZN's research flagship program for Big Data and Informatics will be hosting two Carpentries workshops for
staff and students from their campuses.

Instructors and helpers as well as community champions will have an opportunity to meet and network during a [community building
event](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2018-12-03-KZN-CommunityEvent/) prior to the four workshops.
