## About IMF-2019

Many institutions are already doing some form of identity management, but often the staff involved in this have no formal
understanding of the underlying concepts and theory. This workshop is aimed at institutional identity management staff or
directory administrators -- those people responsible for provisioning user accounts. 

We will start by providing a solid 
understanding of digital identity and the identity management lifecycle in a vendor-neutral way. This serves as an introduction
for those who may be unfamiliar with IdM whilst simultaneously solidifying the theoretical concepts for staff already working
in this space. Building on this knowledge, we go on to introduce the concepts of federated identity generically, explore why 
federation is important to research and education, and look at eduroam and SAFIRE as a specific examples that are relevant in 
South Africa.

## Who should attend?

IMF 2019 is targeted at institutional identity management staff or directory administrators - those people responsible for provisioning user accounts at public universities in South Africa.

In order to benefit fully, attendees should bring their own laptop, and ideally should have some familiarity with LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) installations.
