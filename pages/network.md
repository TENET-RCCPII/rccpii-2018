From 15 - 19 January 2018, the [Network Startup Resource Centre](https://nsrc.org/) ran a Campus Network Design and Operations Workshop in Cape Town, South Africa.

The goals of the event were to:

- train university network engineering staff on how to improve their campus network designs
- learn to implement best practices in switched and routed networks
- strengthen the TENET technical community (human network) in developing TENET's cyberinfrastructure.

More information is available on the [NSRC website](https://nsrc.org/workshops/2018/tenet-nsrc-cndo/).
