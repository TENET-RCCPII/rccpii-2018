RCCPII and SAFIRE are partnering to run an [Identity Management and Federation workshop](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/identity-2019/) instead of the originally planned network monitoring workshops based on massive demand from tertiary and research institutions in South Africa.

More information is available on the [workshop website](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/identity-2019/).
