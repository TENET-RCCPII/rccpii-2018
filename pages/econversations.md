## What is the eConversation Series?

eConversations are regularly scheduled events which offer lecturers, researchers, students, and support staff (or enablers) the opportunity to 
learn more about various topics related to the changing landscape of research and teaching and learning. 

The sessions cuts across disciplines, career stages, and job titles. Typically sessions last 
for up to 90 minutes and are hosted on a virtual platform such as 
[Vidyo](https://www.tenet.ac.za/services/vidyo). Participants only need internet connection
and a device for connecting to the virtual meeting.

## What is in stock for eCConversations 2018?

This year we plan to offer at least one session per month on a fixed day and time slot to make
it easier for the community to join. The sessions will focus on:

- **Tools**: This may include software, hardware, repositories, and more. 
Think R, Python, High Performance Computing Platforms, research equipment, ORCID...
- **Concepts**: There are loads of new concepts applicable to research and teaching 
and learning and we'll aim to invite speakers with experience in these various concepts 
to share their knowledge and stimulate discussion. Concepts may include "reproducible research", 
"blended learning", "open science", "research software engineers"...
- **Events**: Many new events that are relevant to folks from all disciplines, have seen the light and is accessible to academics in South Africa. We will invite people who are running such events, as well 
as those who have (or will be) participated in generally applicable events to share their experiences,
recommendations, and opportunities with our community. Events could include OpenCon, 
International Data Week, Open Access Week, CarpentryCon, Research Data Science Summer Schools, and more.

A full programme will be published shortly to help you get these conversations into your diary.
