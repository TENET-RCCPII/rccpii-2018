## About Carpentry Instructor Training

> Over the last hundred years, researchers have discovered an enormous amount about how people learn and how best to teach them. Unfortunately, much of that knowledge has not yet been translated into common classroom practice, especially at the university level.
>
>This two-day class has the following overall goals:
>
>    Introduce you to evidence-based best-practices of teaching.
>    Teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops.
>    Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills.
>    Help you become integrated into the Carpentry community.
>    Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentry workshops.
>
>Because we have only two days, some things are beyond the scope of this class. We will not be learning:
>
>    How to program in R or Python, use git, or any of the other topics taught in Carpentry workshops.
>    How to create your own lessons from scratch (although you will have a good start on the principles behind that sort of work if you’re inspired to learn more).

## What is happening in South Africa?

Over the past three years more than 60 South African researchers, students, as well as IT and library 
staff have participated in local instructor training events.

Due to the additional requirements for qualification (participate in a 2-day workshop and complete three 
additional [online exercises](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) afterwards), 
several of our trained instructors have not yet qualified. In 2018 we will be running additional online
mentorship sessions and continue to seek funding to increase mobility of our instructors to gain valuable 
experience in teaching. Please visit this site regularly to learn more about opportunities for South African 
Carpentry instructors.
 
The first instructor training event for 2018, funded through <em>RCCP II</em>, will run from 21 - 23 February
in the Western Cape. More information is available at [the event's website](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2018-02-21-South-Africa-ttt/).
