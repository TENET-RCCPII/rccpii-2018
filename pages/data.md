The historical report were drawn for the dates 2016-01-01 until 2019-04-02. *The first RCCPII capacity development event was run in 2016 and was a Data Carpentry workshop at the University of Venda - activities before January 2018 falls outside of the scope of reporting but since the Twitter report was paid for we decided to maximise return on investment and cover earlier dates as well.*
