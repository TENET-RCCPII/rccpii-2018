The Rural Campuses Connection Project (RCCP) was undertaken to provide 
high-bandwidth connections for rural university campuses to the South 
African National Research Network (SANReN). The then HESA received a 
grant of R28 million from the Department of Higher Education and Training 
(DHET) for the project in 2010, and appointed the Tertiary Education and 
Research Network of South Africa (TENET) as the implementing agency.

In  2015  the  DHET  approved  a  new  grant  of  R71  million 
to  HESA  for  the  program proposed under RCCP II.  The proposal envisaged a more rounded and coherent 
intervention that would aim not only to deploy technology but also to augment the 
capacity to use that technology for educational purposes. Thus a significant training 
component was included in the RCCP II proposal - not merely for formal technical skill 
building  but  also  for  more  complex capacity  problems  such  as  policy  and  process 
development  capabilities. RCCP II aims to build upon the achievements of, and lessons learned in RCCP I.
