At the start of the RCCPII Capacity Development Inititive in January 2019, the project team developed a [Theory of Change Model](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/images/RCCPII_ToC2018-03-12.pdf) to plan specific interventions. The aim was to provide capacity development opportunities for the following categories of people:

- IT staff (specifically those involved in providing internet access at universities)
- Teaching and Learning, as well as Research Support staff (including the broader IT staff complement, libraries, research offices, university administrators, teaching and learning professionals, etc.)
- Internet users (in this context referring to the people at universities who drive internet usage including students, researchers, and lecturers).

We also aimed to provide a large number of opportunities for these groups of people to attend RCCPII activities together to learn about each others' worlds and build bridges between support and end users.

## Activities 

The RCCPII Capacity Development Initiative hosted 47 activities in 15 months. The programme included 21 online and 25 in-person activities and reached 775 individuals with many participating in more than one activity. A total of 1,180 participants took part in the programme.
