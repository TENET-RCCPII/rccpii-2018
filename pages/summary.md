At the start of the RCCPII Capacity Development Inititive in January 2019, the project team developed a [Theory of Change Model](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/images/RCCPII_ToC2018-03-12.pdf) to plan specific interventions. The aim was to provide capacity development opportunities for the following categories of people:

- IT staff (specifically those involved in providing internet access at universities)
- Teaching and Learning, as well as Research Support staff (including the broader IT staff complement, libraries, research offices, university administrators, teaching and learning professionals, etc.)
- Internet users (in this context referring to the people at universities who drive internet usage including students, researchers, and lecturers).

We also aimed to provide a large number of opportunities for these groups of people to attend RCCPII activities together to learn about each others' worlds and build bridges between support and end users.

## Activities 

The RCCPII Capacity Development Initiative hosted 47 activities in 15 months. The programme included 21 online and 25 in-person activities and reached 775 individuals with many participating in more than one activity. A total of 1,180 participants took part in the programme.

The map below shows the spread of activities across South Africa.

## Beneficiaries

As mentioned above, the RCCPII capacity development initiative reached 775 individuals with several participants taking part in more than one activity. Over the 15 months we had 81 people acting as instructors and 30 acting as helpers. Some people instructed several times.

The plot below (downloaded from the RCCPII Shiny App) shows the diversity in participants' disciplines as well as their job role at the time of the activity.

The RCCPII capacity development initiative team set out from the start, with the vision of making the activities accessible to the broadest possible contingent of South African students (mostly targeting postgraduate students), academics, and support staff. The plot below shows the diversity that was achieved in terms of race and gender.
