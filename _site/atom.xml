			<summary>From 21 to 23 February 2018 researchers, postgraduate students, IT, and library staff will be able to learn how to teach programming at the fourth in-person Software and Data Carpentry Instructor Training workshop in South Africa.</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/rccpii-2018/carpentries/instructor/">&lt;p&gt;In 2016 and 2017 three Software, Data, and Library Carpentry instructor training events 
were run in South Africa. These train-the-trainers events were well-attended by researchers, 
IT staff as well as librarians. Participants came from a wide range of universities and companies from all over the country and even from other African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/&quot;&gt;Carpentry instructor training&lt;/a&gt; aims to teach those who can already use tools such as R, Python, Shell, Git, Matlab, and 
OpenRefine, to become better teachers of these tools. The Carpentries’ lessons are specifically aimed
at people who work in research settings. The training includes topics such as assessment, how learning works, how to organise and run a Carpentry workshop, and more. It does not teach the tools itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Software, Data, and Library Carpentry, please see:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datacarpentry.org/&quot;&gt;Data Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; (typically for people who analyse data as part of their research/work/studies)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://librarycarpentry.github.io/&quot;&gt;Library Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; (typically for librarians who want to learn new ways of supporting researchers and being more productive in their work)&lt;/li&gt;
